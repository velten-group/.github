# Welcome to Velten Group!

We are a [research group at University Heidelberg](https://www.cos.uni-heidelberg.de/en/research-groups/biological-data-science) working at the interface of data science, machine learning and the life sciences. We develop computational tools and statistical methods that are required to translate large-scale molecular data sets (‘omics data’) into biological insights and novel discoveries.
